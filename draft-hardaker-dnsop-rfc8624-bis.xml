<t>[EDITOR NOTE: This document does not change the status (MUST, MAY,
   RECOMMENDED, etc) of any of the algorithsm listed in RFC8624; that is
   the work of future documents.  Instead, this document simply moves
   the canonical list of algorithms from RFC8624 to an IANA registry.
   This is done for two reasons: 1) to allow the list to be updated more
   easily, and, much more importantly, 2) to allow the list to be more
   easily referenced.]  The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various
   cryptographic algorithms in order to provide authentication of DNS
   data and proof of non-existence.  To ensure interoperability between
   DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is necessary to
   specify a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage
   guidelines to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all
   implementations support.  This document updates RFC8624 by moving the
   canonical source of algorithm implementation requirements and usage
   guidance for DNSSEC from RFC8624 to an IANA registry.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC4034] is used to provide
   authentication of DNS data.  The DNSSEC signing algorithms are
   defined by various RFCs, including [RFC4034], [RFC5155], [RFC5702],
   [RFC5933], [RFC6605], [RFC8080].  To ensure interoperability, a set
   of "mandatory-to-implement" DNSKEY algorithms are defined in
   [RFC8624].  In order to make the current status of the algorithms
   more easily accessible and understandable, this document moves the
   canonical status of the algorithms from RFC8624 to the IANA DNSSEC
   algorithm registries.  [ Editor: This is similar to the process used
   for the TLS ciphersuites - https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-
   parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4 ]</t>

<section anchor="updating-algorithm-implementation-requirements-and-usage-guidance"><name>Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance</name>

<t>The field of cryptography evolves continuously.  New stronger
   algorithms appear and existing algorithms are found to be less secure
   then originally thought.  Therefore, algorithm implementation
   requirements and usage guidance need to be updated from time to time
   to reflect the new reality.  The choices for algorithms must be
   conservative to minimize the risk of algorithm compromise.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="updating-algorithm-requirement-levels"><name>Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels</name>

<t>The mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should already be
   available in most implementations of DNSSEC by the time it is made
   mandatory.  This document attempts to identify and introduce those
   algorithms for future mandatory-to-implement status.  There is no
   guarantee that algorithms in use today will become mandatory in the
   future.  Published algorithms are continuously subjected to
   cryptographic attack and may become too weak, or even be completely
   broken, before this document is updated.</t>

<t>[ [TODO (WK): This section needs to be updated. ]] This document
   provides recommendations with respect to mandatory-to-implement
   algorithms, algorithms so weak that they cannot be recommended, and
   algorithms defined in RFCs that are not on the standards track.  Any
   algorithm listed in the [DNSKEY-IANA] and [DS-IANA] registries that
   are not mentioned in this document MAY be implemented.  For
   clarification and consistency, an algorithm will be specified as MAY
   in this document only when it has been downgraded from a MUST or a
   RECOMMENDED to a MAY.</t>

<t>[TODO (WK): Ditto! ] Although this document's primary purpose is to
   update algorithm recommendations to keep DNSSEC authentication secure
   over time, it also aims to do so in such a way that DNSSEC
   implementations remain interoperable.  DNSSEC interoperability is
   addressed by an incremental introduction or deprecation of
   algorithms.</t>

<t>[RFC2119] considers the term SHOULD equivalent to RECOMMENDED, and
   SHOULD NOT equivalent to NOT RECOMMENDED.  The authors of this
   document have chosen to use the terms RECOMMENDED and NOT
   RECOMMENDED, as this more clearly expresses the recommendations to
   implementers.</t>

<t>It is expected that deprecation of an algorithm will be performed
   gradually.  This provides time for various implementations to update
   their implemented algorithms while remaining interoperable.  Unless
   there are strong security reasons, an algorithm is expected to be
   downgraded from MUST to NOT RECOMMENDED or MAY, instead of to MUST
   NOT.  Similarly, an algorithm that has not been mentioned as
   mandatory-to-implement is expected to be introduced with a
   RECOMMENDED instead of a MUST.</t>

<t>Since the effect of using an unknown DNSKEY algorithm is that the
   zone is treated as insecure, it is recommended that algorithms
   downgraded to NOT RECOMMENDED or lower not be used by authoritative
   nameservers and DNSSEC signers to create new DNSKEY's.  This will
   allow for deprecated algorithms to become less and less common over
   time.  Once an algorithm has reached a sufficiently low level of
   deployment, it can be marked as MUST NOT, so that recursive resolvers
   can remove support for validating it.</t>

<t>Recursive nameservers are encouraged to retain support for all
   algorithms not marked as MUST NOT.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="document-audience"><name>Document Audience</name>

<t>The recommendations of this document mostly target DNSSEC
   implementers, as implementations need to meet both high security
   expectations as well as high interoperability between various vendors
   and with different versions.  Interoperability requires a smooth
   transition to more secure algorithms.  This perspective may differ
   from from that of a user who wishes to deploy and configure DNSSEC
   with only the safest algorithm.  On the other hand, the comments and
   recommendations in this document are also expected to be useful for
   such users.</t>

<t>RSAMD5 is not widely deployed and there is an industry-wide trend to
   deprecate MD5 usage.</t>

<t>RSASHA1 and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 are widely deployed, although zones
   deploying it are recommended to switch to ECDSAP256SHA256 as there is
   an industry-wide trend to move to elliptic curve cryptography.
   RSASHA1 does not support NSEC3.  RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 can be used with
   or without NSEC3.</t>

<t>DSA and DSA-NSEC3-SHA1 are not widely deployed and vulnerable to
   private key compromise when generating signatures using a weak or
   compromised random number generator.</t>

<t>RSASHA256 is in wide use and considered strong.</t>

<t>RSASHA512 is NOT RECOMMENDED for DNSSEC Signing because it has not
   seen wide deployment, but there are some deployments hence DNSSEC
   Validation MUST implement RSASHA512 to ensure interoperability.
   There is no significant difference in cryptographics strength between
   RSASHA512 and RSASHA256, therefore it is discouraged to use
   RSASHA512, as it will only make deprecation of older algorithms
   harder.  People that wish to use a cryptographically stronger
   algorithm should switch to elliptic curve cryptography algorithms.</t>

<t>ECC-GOST (GOST R 34.10-2001) has been superseded by GOST R 34.10-2012
   in [RFC7091].  GOST R 34.10-2012 has been standardized for use in
   DNSSEC in draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc5933-bis.</t>

<t>ECDSAP256SHA256 provides more cryptographic strength with a shorter
   signature length than either RSASHA256 or RSASHA512.  ECDSAP256SHA256
   has been widely deployed and therefore it is now at MUST level for
   both validation and signing.  It is RECOMMENDED to use deterministic
   digital signature generation procedure of the ECDSA ([RFC6979]) when
   implementing ECDSAP256SHA256 (and ECDSAP384SHA384).</t>

<t>ECDSAP384SHA384 shares the same properties as ECDSAP256SHA256, but
   offers a modest security advantage over ECDSAP256SHA256 (192 bits of
   strength versus 128 bits).  For most DNSSEC applications,
   ECDSAP256SHA256 should be satisfactory and robust for the foreseeable
   future, and is therefore recommended for signing.  While it is
   unlikely for a DNSSEC use case requiring 192-bit security strength to
   arise, ECDSA384SHA384 is provided for such applications and it MAY be
   used for signing in these cases.</t>

<t>ED25519 and ED448 use Edwards-curve Digital Security Algorithm
   (EdDSA).  There are three main advantages of the EdDSA algorithm: It
   does not require the use of a unique random number for each
   signature, there are no padding or truncation issues as with ECDSA,
   and it is more resilient to side-channel attacks.  Furthermore, EdDSA
   cryptography is less prone to implementation errors ([RFC8032],
   [RFC8080]).  It is expected that ED25519 will become the future
   RECOMMENDED default algorithm once there's enough support for this
   algorithm in the deployed DNSSEC validators.</t>

<t>Operation recommendation for new and existing deployments.</t>

<t>Due to industry-wide trend to move to elliptic curve cryptography,
   the ECDSAP256SHA256 is RECOMMENDED DNSKEY algorithm for use by new
   DNSSEC deployments, and users of RSA based algorithms SHOULD upgrade
   to ECDSAP256SHA256.</t>

<t>[*] - This is a special type of CDS record signaling removal of DS at
   the parent in [RFC8078]</t>

<t>NULL is a special case, see [RFC8078]</t>

<t>SHA-1 is in declining use for DS records, so it is NOT RECOMMENDED
   for validators to implement SHA-1 validation.  SHA-1 MUST NOT be used
   in generating new DS and CDS records.  (See Operational
   Considerations for caveats when upgrading from SHA-1 to SHA-256 DS
   Algorithm.)</t>

<t>SHA-256 is in wide use and considered strong.</t>

<t>GOST R 34.11-94 has been superseded by GOST R 34.11-2012 in
   [RFC6986].  The GOST R 34.11-2012 hasn't been standardized for use in
   DNSSEC.</t>

<t>SHA-384 shares the same properties as SHA-256, but offers a modest
   security advantage over SHA-384 (384-bits of strength versus
   256-bits).  For most applications of DNSSEC, SHA-256 should be
   satisfactory and robust for the foreseeable future, and is therefore
   recommended for DS and CDS records.  While it is unlikely for a
   DNSSEC use case requiring 384-bit security strength to arise, SHA-384
   is provided for such applications and it MAY be used for generating
   DS and CDS records in these cases.</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>The security of cryptographic systems depends on both the strength of
   the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of the keys used
   with those algorithms.  The security also depends on the engineering
   of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are no non-
   cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the overall system.</t>

<t>This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
   algorithms for the use of DNSSEC, specifically with the selection of
   "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms.  The algorithms identified in
   this document as MUST or RECOMMENDED to implement are not known to be
   broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far leads
   us to believe that they are likely to remain secure into the
   foreseeable future.  However, this isn't necessarily forever, and it
   is expected that new revisions of this document will be issued from
   time to time to reflect the current best practices in this area.</t>

<t>Retiring an algorithm too soon would result in a zone signed with the
   retired algorithm being downgraded to the equivalent of an unsigned
   zone.  Therefore, algorithm deprecation must be done very slowly and
   only after careful consideration and measurement of its use.</t>

<t>DNSKEY algorithm rollover in a live zone is a complex process.  See
   [RFC6781] and [RFC7583] for guidelines on how to perform algorithm

<t>DS algorithm rollover in a live zone is also a complex process.
   Upgrading algorithm at the same time as rolling the new KSK key will
   lead to DNSSEC validation failures, and users MUST upgrade the DS
   algorithm first before rolling the Key Signing Key.</t>

<t>The following table contains the status of support in the open-source
   DNS signers and validators in the current released versions as of the
   time writing this document.  Usually, the support for specific
